# React TODO

This is my first app using React. The code will be improved with experience :metal: :tada:

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/samuel27m/react-todo.git
cd react-todo
npm install
npm start
```

## What does it use?

- React :roll_eyes:
- Bootstrap v4
- Sweetalert2

## PWA
Yes! This app uses the provided tools by React to be PWA compatible! [Open the website](https://samuel27m.github.io/react-todo) in your phone and you will see the button to add it to your home screen :smile: :tada:

## How does this save my tasks?
This app saves your tasks using the ```localStorage``` object, this means **your tasks will be saved offline**! 
Unfortunately also means that the data is not saved across all your devices :disappointed:
